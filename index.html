        <br />
        <p>I used to associate the spectrum of purple hues</p>
        <p>and the delicate tints of violets with Sappho. I think</p>
        <p>about sapphic love, a love condemned for simply being,</p>
        <p>for flourishing between women in a world unready to embrace it.</p>
        <p>How the love I give is deemed as sinful. A bit of a negative connotation</p>
        <p>connotation that clings to it, hmm? As if love could ever be</p>
        <p>wrong for simply existing as we are.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Now, the sight of those shades always bring you to mind.</p>
        <p>I think about your eyes—how they look at me. I picture your lips</p>
        <p>and how I could spend hours tracing the curve of them with my thoughts.</p>
        <p>I think about the warmth in your laugh, how it lingers in the air </p>
        <p>long after you've gone. I think of you. Your name. Hyacynth.</p>
        <br />
        <p>And somehow, my thoughts aren't just confined to my mind anymore.</p>
        <p> I seek your color in every tone I come across, as if it has always belonged to you.</p>
        <p>I search for the flower that bears your name, as though nature itself had intended to craft a bloom 
          as breathtaking as you to name it in your honor.</p>
        <p> And with every encounter, I find myself more certain that the universe, in its own subtle way,
           was always meant to reflect the essence of you.</p>
        <br />
        <p>What was once a symbol of something suppressed has become the embodiment of everything I adore. </p>
        <p>These hues no longer carry shame or silence, but instead a quiet, unyielding joy, 
          a celebration of everything you are to me.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Always thinking of you,
        <p>Dom</p>
